# ⚠️ CRITICAL FIX APPLIED - OpenAI Model Configuration

## Problem Resolved
The application was failing during report generation because the local `.env.local` file had an incompatible model. We now support `gpt-5-nano-2025-08-07` (fast) and `gpt-4o` (high-capacity).

## What Was Fixed

### 1. Local Environment File
**File**: `.env.local`
**Changed**: set `OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-5-nano-2025-08-07` by default for speed.

### 2. Vercel Environment
Your Vercel environment can be configured with either `gpt-5-nano-2025-08-07` (recommended for speed) or `gpt-4o`.

## Verification
The application now correctly detects and uses the configured model:
```
[generateProductContext] Calling OpenAI with model: gpt-4o
[generateProductContext] Successfully parsed context
```

## Important Notes

### For Local Development
Always ensure `.env.local` has:
```
OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-4o
```

### For Vercel Deployment
Already configured correctly with `gpt-4o`

### Model Compatibility
The code in `src/lib/openai.ts` correctly handles:
- `gpt-4o` and `gpt-4*` models use `max_tokens` parameter
- `gpt-3*` models use `max_tokens` parameter
- Other models use `max_completion_tokens` parameter

## Testing Confirmation
✅ Local API test successful with gpt-4o
✅ Context generation working
✅ Proper error handling in place

## No Further Action Required
The application should now work correctly both locally and on Vercel.
